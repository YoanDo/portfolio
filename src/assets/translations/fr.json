Always looking for new designs, fonts, colors, photos - I love to make nice things work.  Graduated from a business school with a specialization in Luxury marketing, I worked as Project Manager for a few years until I realize that I was missing DOING stuff.  After a revealing coding bootcamp, I start working for the promising start up Happydemics for two years. My job there was focused on the interaction with the user. I loved it. I'm currently working as consultant for Cdiscount, the biggest french marketplace. ",
